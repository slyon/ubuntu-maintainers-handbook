# Ubuntu Maintainer's Handbook

This handbook explains how to do the common tasks of an Ubuntu package
maintainer. In particular, it explains how the git-ubuntu tool-suite is used
for working with Ubuntu packages.

If you are interested in contributing to Ubuntu, you may want to attain certain
uploading rights. For guidance on where to start, check out the
[path to upload rights](Reference/PathToUploadRights.md) page.

Note that this isn't a policy document; the official policies will be linked to
where possible and should be referenced for the officially correct ways to do
things. Instead, this is intended to serve as a tutorial style introduction to
help new Ubuntu packagers get up to speed.

Similarly, this handbook doesn't attempt to cover topics comprehensively. There
are many ways to do things, and some alternate approaches may be faster or
better in special cases, but this will try to provide the reader with a solid
working knowledge of one robust process for accomplishing work items.
